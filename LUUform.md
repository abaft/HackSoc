**Leeds University Union. **

**Student Activities Formation Form**

Student activities offer a brilliant way to get involved in the Union,
meet new people, improve your CV and organise the events that you want
to go to.

**Group name: L.U.U. [ ]{.underline}**

**Why do you want to set up this group as part of LUU and what do you
aim to do?** [ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_]{.underline}

**What benefits and opportunities will you provide to members which they
would not otherwise have?** [
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_]{.underline}

**How do you see the society developing in the next twelve months?**

**Are you sure your aims and objectives are not in conflict with any
existing group or union policy?**

**Committee Members**

Each group is led by a President/Captain/Chair, Secretary and Treasurer.
They are responsible for the management of the group and are the main
contact for the students and the LUU. LUU now recognises the ability of
societies to structure themselves in different ways and you will be able
to change your constitution to reflect this, if you want, once you are a
full LUU society.

**So what happens next?**

Once you've completed the form submit it to the student activities
reception on level 1 of LUU. Make sure you have 25 signatures and
student numbers of current students who want to join your group.

In submitting your form we will then ask you to meet with the Activities
Officer, the LUU Staff Specialist and activity rep for your group's
category. This meeting will just be a chance to talk through your ideas
and for you to ask any questions. We then ask you do a formation event
(a kind of taster session) for your activity. This will be to gauge
interest from potential members, see how you work together as a
committee and raise the profile of the group. You can contact the
development coordinator in student activities for help setting up this
session. This will not only be good experience for you and your group in
organising events, but will also help jump-start your membership numbers
once you have formed.

Following your taster session, you must provide feedback and pictures to
the Activities Officer who will then take your application to the
activities exec. The Activities Exec is a group of 13 elected student
representatives from all areas of activities. They make the final
decision on all applications.

If successful your group will fall into one of the following 13
specialized categories:

1.  **Political and Campaigning 8. Dance**

2.  **Faith 9. Culture**

3.  **Performance & Music 10. General Interest**

4.  **Sports 11. Volunteering **

5.  **Martial Arts 12. Media**

6.  **Outdoor Activities 13. Academic**

7.  **Welfare **

Each category has a specific staff member and an elected student
representative (on the **activities exec**) who both represent and
support groups throughout the year.

If you have any problems during the Formation Process feel free to
contact the Activities Officer, Tai Ogunyinka, on
<T.Ogunyinka@leeds.ac.uk>, the Clubs and Societies Coordinator, Helena
Goode on <h.r.goode@leeds.ac.uk> or the student activities team on
<Activities@leeds.ac.uk>.
