# HackSoc Manifesto

## Events > We will ...

* Have weekly meetings in order to establish details about new events
* Have weekly programming project presentations
* Have bi-weekly meetings for computer passionates
* Organize more hackathons than CompSoc (losers)

Our priority is to maximise the number of people interested in programming and IT by having fun social events where everyone can share their opinion about the subject.
