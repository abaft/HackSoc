# Notes

## The Future

In the future we would hope to increase the number of events we are able to run, along with building the membership and popularity of our group.
We also would love to explore and integrate other techincal hobbies into our society, such as amateur radio and hobbyist electronics.

## CompSoc

The group CompSoc is a group whose aims and goals, at first glance, appear to overlap with ours, however, we think that our society is unique in the sense that it widens the scope of what a computing society offers.
CompSoc is yet to run any of the events proposed in this document this academic year (2017/18), and as such we see them not as competitors to this society.

## The LUU

We hope that being a part of the LUU would lend us a certain degree of legitimacy which we could use to attract speaker and members alike.
There are clear advantages, including the offer of funding to our group.

We would also like to operate in cooperation with other societies in the LUU and be an active participant in the general student body.

## Membership Fee

To aid in funding the society we would expect a membership fee of \textsterling4.
