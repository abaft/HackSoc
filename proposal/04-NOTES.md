# Notes

## The Future

In the future we would hope to ramp up the number of events we are able to run and build the membership and popularity of our group.
We also would love to explore and intergrate other techincal hobbies into our society, such as Amature Radio and hobbist electronics.

## CompSoc

The group CompSoc is a group whos aims and goals, at first glance, appear to overlap with our aims and goals.
We think that this society is unique in the sense that it widens the scope of what a computing society offers.
CompSoc is yet to run any of the events proposed in this document in this academic year, and as such we see them not as competitors to this society

## The LUU

We hope that being a part of the LUU would lend us a certain legitimacy which we could use to attract speaker and members alike.
There are clear advantages, including the offer of funding to our group.

We also would like to operate in cooperation with other societies in the LUU and be active participant in the general student body.
