# Events

## Weekly Meetings
Our weekly meetings will be for the members of HackSoc to get together, discuss their projects and ideas, make friends, and generally become better acquainted with each other.
On occasion this weekly meeting may be overtaken by a specific event; be this a 'social' or an organised speaker/presentation.
A meeting place for the regular meetings is yet to be found, we suspect this will be a bar or public house in the local area.
At this meeting we would give time to any member who wanted to present their projects to their peers, and provide adequate infrastructure for this to occur.

## Hackathons
We would hope to organise regular 'hackathons'.
A hackathon is an event in which participants are given a particular brief and given a limited amount of time to create and present their solution.
This solution is then usually judged to a specific criteria and the best solution is selected.
Often this would involve some sort of prize.

## Outreach/GIAGs
It is our opinion that the rates of technical literacy among the general university population is low.
We feel that in our fast adapting modern world a these basic technical skills are becoming evermore necessary, and as a society of technically literate people, we feel it our duty to inform others of how they can make computers work for them (and not the other way around).
To that end, we would attempt to run 'outreach' events, in which we invite people from all over the university to 'Give It A Go' and learn something they didn't know about computers.
The themes could be almost anything basic principles of computer programming to basic web development and our aim would be to have people come out more informed than when they went in.

## Speakers
As aluded to earlier, we as HackSoc would intend to invite various experts in their feilds to give guest lectures/seminars on their area of experties.
This would require us to have sufficent resourses for speaker fees etc. and is likely to be our single biggest expence.
We hope, however, the union and the School Of Computing would help fincace these talks as they would be enourmously benificial to the students studying these diciplines and the union.
