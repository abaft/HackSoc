# Events

## Weekly Meetings
Our weekly meetings will be for the members of HackSoc to get together; discuss their projects and ideas; make friends and generally become better acquainted with one another.
On occasion this weekly meeting may be overtaken by a specific event; be this a _social_ an organised speaker or a presentation.
A location for the regular meetings is yet to be found, however, we suspect this will be a bar or public house in the local area.
At this meeting we would give time to any member who wanted to present their projects to their peers, and provide adequate infrastructure for this to occur.

## Hackathons
We would hope to organise regular _hackathons_.
A hackathon is an event in which participants are given a particular brief and a limited amount of time to create and present their solution.
This solution is then judged to a specific criteria and the best is selected as the winner.
Hopefully this would involve some sort of prize.

## Outreach/GIAGs
We would attempt to run _outreach_ events, in which we invite people from all over the university to 'Give It A Go' and learn something they did not know.
The themes could be almost anything, from basic principles of computer programming to the fundamentals of game development.
Our aim would be to promote technical aptitude among our peers.

## Speakers
As aluded to earlier, as HackSoc we would intend to invite various experts in their fields to give guest lectures/seminars on their area of experties.
This would require us to have sufficent resourses for speaker fees, which is likely to be our single biggest expence.
We hope, however, the union and the School of Computing would help fincace these talks as they would be enourmously benificial to the students studying technical diciplines.
